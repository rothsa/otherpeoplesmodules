# Other Peoples Modules
Presentation method: Reveal.js 

## Summary
Writing puppet to cover all the different parts of your system is a lot less time consuming if you use modules already available on the web to compliment what you build yourself. There are a number of ways to do this and keep track of which modules you are using and their updates, including git submodules, librarian-puppet, and r10k. This talk covers how to use those methods, how to adapt the modules you've included to your needs, and how to contribute back to the community.

## Outline

## Part One
 * Introduction 
 (10 manifests for 40+ servers
 30+ modules for applications to configure, install order, configuration, compatibility, not including modules that determine roles and profiles. 
 How do I organize configuration of an application with all of these moving pieces? 
 What kinds of things will I need to know beforehand? Whatâ€™s important? What needs lots of bespoke configuration? How will the advantages and limitations of Puppet affect the way that I define an application's configuration?)
 * Problem statement (I may not have enough time to write all this stuff, how do I get it all done, be ready for the launch, and still have time for the other things that I need to do?)
 * Presentation outline (You're looking at it, below)

## Part Two
 * Librarian-puppet, implementation and module manipulations 
 * r10k, implementation and module manipulations

## Part Three
 * What makes a good module on the Forge (options!)
 * Outline review and followup
